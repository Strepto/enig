# Enig

Enig is an application for estimation. Its a lightweight tool for agreeing on scope across a team of people.

Its inspired by the planning technique "TFB / NFC / 1 Sprint" estimation

Try it out at:

<https://enig.lamdera.app/>

## The idea

Join users in rooms, and make it as easy as possible to add users, add votes and manage the session. Every user should in know each other, and be connected on voice chat (or even better: in the same room).

## The exercise

The application is written in Elm (<https://elm-lang.org>) and Lamdera (<https://lamdera.com>).

## Dev environment

Enig uses `lamdera` for development.

Just install `lamdera` from the [website](https://lamdera.com), and run `lamdera live` to spin up the development environment!

Everything should work automatically!
